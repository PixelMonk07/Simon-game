# Simon Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Simon Game** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery**. The game tests the player's memory by generating a random sequence of colors that the player must replicate.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. The game will flash a color to begin the sequence.
3. Click the buttons in the correct order to match the generated sequence.
4. The sequence gets longer with each correct round.
5. If you click the wrong button, the game ends, and you can restart by pressing any key.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the game.
- **CSS** – Styling and animations.
- **JavaScript (jQuery)** – Game logic and interactivity.
